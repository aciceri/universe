# Universe

This repository is my comprehensive monorepo containing personal projects
and configurations that aren't intended for external contributions,
though contributions are always welcome.

It follows the [dendritic pattern](https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic),
meaning each file is a [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/) module.
Also, this README is dynamically generated using a flake-parts module, with its
source distributed throughout the repository.

## Autogenerated files

The following files are automatically generated:

- [.forgejo/workflows/build-checks.yaml](.forgejo/workflows/build-checks.yaml)
- [.gitignore](.gitignore)
- [README.md](README.md)
- [packages/\_nur.nix](packages/_nur.nix)
